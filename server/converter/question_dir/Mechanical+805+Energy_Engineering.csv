Which calorific value is same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion?,a) Net calorific value,b) Flash point value,c) Gross calorific value,d) Fire point value,d,"Explanation: Gross calorific value is as same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion since the enthalpy change for the reaction assumes a common temperature of the compounds before and after combustion, in which case the water produced by combustion is condensed to a liquid, hence yielding its latent heat of vaporization.

The latent heat lost to the atmosphere depends on evaporation pressure and the amount of water vapors formed. Due to difficulty in measuring the evaporation pressure, it is assumed that evaporation takes place at a saturation temperature of 15oC. The latent heat corresponding to this saturation is 2466kl/kg.                                    m = mass of water vapour formed per kg of fuel burnt . "

Question 168,"10. Which is the process from which heat for distillation comes, in under feed system?",a) Conduction,b) Combustion,c) Synthesis reaction,d) Circulation of hot air gases,a,Explanation: The heat for the distillation comes by conduction from the mass of incandescent fuel bed existing above the raw coal.

What is the purpose of secondary fan’s air in under feed system?,a) To support gases coming out of fuel bed,b) To clear the ash from the upper beds,c) To maintain constant pressure in system,d) To support combustion of system,a,Explanation: The gases coming out of raw fuel bed pass through a region of incandescent ash on the surface of the fuel and finally discharged to the furnace. As the gases coming out of fuel bed also contain combustible matter the supply of secondary air is required in this case. The ash left at the bottom of the stoker is at a higher temperature than the over feed stoker .
Question 171,13. What is the significance of rate at which air is supplied in the under feed system?,a) Increase depth of incandescent zone,b) Pushes up ignition zone,c) Burns fuel for long time,d) Supports combustion,a,"Explanation:  The rate of air supply has marked effect on the speed of ignition in case of under feed burning as the rising air cools the raw fuel prior to ignition. At low rate of air fuel, the heat flow by conduction from the incandescent fuel bed downward is faster than the removal of heat by air. This pushes the ignition plane down below the bed surface and creates a maximum depth of incandescent zone."
Question 172,14. Which type of coal is used in the under feed system?,a) Anthracite coal,b) Bituminous coal,c) Briquette coal,d) Pulverized coal,b,Explanation: The under feed method uses bituminous coals which have high volatile matter.
